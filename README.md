Data Analysis Final Project for Sports & Exercise Analytics Master's Class

This project was performed to analyze commonly used ingredients and their nutritional contents using supervised machine learning techniques (Random Forest, K-Nearest Negighbor, Naive Bayes, Classification Tree). In doing so, ingredients can be compared to one another to find commonalities and therefore create a basis for a recipe recommendation system. This ongoing project will be utilized to develop an application that heps to simplify healthy eating by providing users with foods and recipes similar to those that they commonly eat (or that align with their health goals), providing more variety in their diet and reducing monotony in meal prep and healthy eating practices.

To run this code make sure you install the required R libraries shown at the top of the R file. Next make sure to download the provided datasets and point the associated variables to the location of your downloads
